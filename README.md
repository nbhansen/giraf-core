# GIRAF Core API

Shared domain service for the GIRAF platform — manages users, organizations, citizens, grades, pictograms, invitations, and JWT authentication.

## How Other Apps Use Core

GIRAF Core is the **single source of truth** for all shared data. The platform has three app-specific backends (Weekplanner, Food Planner, VTA), and they all depend on Core rather than duplicating user/org/citizen management:

1. **Users log in through Core.** A mobile app calls `POST /api/v1/token/pair` with username + password. Core returns a JWT access token that contains an `org_roles` claim — a dictionary like `{"1": "owner", "5": "member"}` mapping organization IDs to the user's role.

2. **App backends validate JWTs locally.** They share the same `JWT_SECRET` as Core, so they can decode and verify tokens without making a network call. The `org_roles` claim inside the token tells them what the user is allowed to do — no need to query Core on every request.

3. **App backends call Core for shared data.** When the Weekplanner backend needs to verify that a citizen exists before creating an activity, it calls Core's API (e.g. `GET /api/v1/citizens/{id}`). Core is the authority — app backends never store their own copy of users, orgs, or citizens.

4. **Each app stores only its own domain data.** Weekplanner stores activities and schedules. VTA stores exercises and progress. Food Planner stores meals and menus. Each has its own database. Core holds everything shared.

## Architecture

### Stack

- **Python 3.12+** with **Django 5** and **Django Ninja** (fast, type-safe API layer)
- **PostgreSQL 16** (dev/prod) — **SQLite in-memory** for tests
- **JWT authentication** via django-ninja-jwt (access tokens: 1 hour, refresh tokens: 7 days)
- **`uv`** as the package manager

### Design Pattern: Service Layer

Every Django app in this project follows the same four-file structure:

```
models.py  →  schemas.py  →  services.py  →  api.py
```

Here's what each file does and why:

- **`models.py`** — Django ORM models. Defines the database tables and relationships.
- **`schemas.py`** — Pydantic-based input/output schemas (via Django Ninja). Defines what data the API accepts and returns. Keeps serialization separate from business logic.
- **`services.py`** — **All business logic lives here.** Services are static methods wrapped in `@transaction.atomic`. They raise domain exceptions (not HTTP errors) when something goes wrong.
- **`api.py`** — Thin endpoint layer. Each endpoint does three things: (1) check permissions, (2) call a service method, (3) return the response. No business logic here.

This separation matters because:
- Business rules are testable without HTTP — you can unit-test services directly.
- Endpoints stay small and consistent.
- When a rule changes, you know exactly where to look.

### Error Handling

Services raise domain exceptions from `core/exceptions.py`. These are caught by centralized exception handlers in `config/api.py` and mapped to HTTP status codes:

| Exception                  | HTTP Status | When to use                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `BadRequestError`          | 400         | Invalid input that isn't a validation issue |
| `ResourceNotFoundError`    | 404         | Entity doesn't exist                     |
| `ConflictError`            | 409         | Duplicate resource (e.g. username taken) |
| `BusinessValidationError`  | 422         | Domain validation failure                |
| `ServiceError`             | 500         | Unexpected internal error                |

All error responses use the same shape: `{"detail": "Human-readable message"}`.

### Role System

Roles are per-organization, stored in the `Membership` model. The hierarchy is:

```
owner  >  admin  >  member
```

A permission check for `min_role=admin` will pass for both admins **and** owners. This is handled by `check_role_or_raise()` in `core/permissions.py`, which every endpoint calls before delegating to the service layer.

| Role       | Capabilities                                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **member** | Read org data, create/update citizens                    |
| **admin**  | + invite users, manage grades/pictograms, remove members |
| **owner**  | + update/delete org, change member roles                 |

### JWT Authentication

When a user logs in (`POST /api/v1/token/pair`), Core returns an access token with a custom `org_roles` claim embedded in the JWT payload:

```json
{
  "org_roles": {"1": "owner", "5": "member"}
}
```

This means any backend sharing the same `JWT_SECRET` can authorize requests locally — no call back to Core needed. The custom claim is built in `core/jwt.py` by querying the user's memberships at login time.

## API Reference

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`. Unless noted, all require a valid JWT Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

Interactive docs are available at **http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs** when running locally.

### Authentication & Users

| Method   | Endpoint                    | Auth | Description                             |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/auth/register`            | None | Register a new user                     |
| `POST`   | `/token/pair`               | None | Login — returns access + refresh tokens |
| `POST`   | `/token/refresh`            | None | Refresh an expired access token         |
| `POST`   | `/token/verify`             | None | Verify a token is valid                 |
| `POST`   | `/token/blacklist`          | JWT  | Blacklist a refresh token (logout)      |
| `GET`    | `/users/me`                 | JWT  | Get current user profile                |
| `PUT`    | `/users/me`                 | JWT  | Update profile (first_name, last_name, email) |
| `PUT`    | `/users/me/password`        | JWT  | Change password                         |
| `DELETE` | `/users/me`                 | JWT  | Delete account                          |
| `POST`   | `/users/me/profile-picture` | JWT  | Upload profile picture (JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 5MB) |

#### Register

```
POST /api/v1/auth/register
```

```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "password": "Str0ngPass!",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "first_name": "Alice",
  "last_name": "Smith"
}
```

Only `username` and `password` are required. Returns `201` with user data. `409` if username taken. `422` if password too weak (min 8 characters, can't be too similar to username, can't be a common password).

#### Login

```
POST /api/v1/token/pair
```

```json
{ "username": "alice", "password": "Str0ngPass!" }
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "access": "eyJ...",
  "refresh": "eyJ...",
  "org_roles": {
    "1": "owner",
    "5": "admin",
    "12": "member"
  }
}
```

The `org_roles` claim is also embedded inside the JWT access token payload itself, so app backends can decode the token to determine user roles without calling Core.

Rate-limited to **5 requests/minute** per IP.

#### Update Profile

```
PUT /api/v1/users/me
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

```json
{
  "first_name": "Alice",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```

All fields are optional — only provided fields are updated.

#### Change Password

```
PUT /api/v1/users/me/password
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

```json
{
  "old_password": "OldPass123!",
  "new_password": "NewStr0ngPass!"
}
```

Returns `422` if old password is incorrect or new password doesn't meet strength requirements.

### Organizations

| Method   | Endpoint                                    | Min Role | Description                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/organizations`                            | JWT      | Create org (creator becomes owner) |
| `GET`    | `/organizations`                            | JWT      | List user's organizations          |
| `GET`    | `/organizations/{org_id}`                   | member   | Get org detail                     |
| `PATCH`  | `/organizations/{org_id}`                   | owner    | Update org name                    |
| `DELETE` | `/organizations/{org_id}`                   | owner    | Delete org                         |
| `GET`    | `/organizations/{org_id}/members`           | member   | List members                       |
| `PATCH`  | `/organizations/{org_id}/members/{user_id}` | owner    | Update member role                 |
| `DELETE` | `/organizations/{org_id}/members/{user_id}` | admin    | Remove member                      |

Safety guard: you cannot remove or demote the last owner of an organization (returns `400`).

### Citizens

Citizens are the kids with autism who belong to an organization.

| Method   | Endpoint                           | Min Role | Description          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/organizations/{org_id}/citizens` | member   | Create citizen       |
| `GET`    | `/organizations/{org_id}/citizens` | member   | List citizens in org |
| `GET`    | `/citizens/{citizen_id}`           | member   | Get citizen detail   |
| `PATCH`  | `/citizens/{citizen_id}`           | member   | Update citizen       |
| `DELETE` | `/citizens/{citizen_id}`           | admin    | Delete citizen       |

---

### Grades

Grades group citizens within an organization (e.g. "Class 3A"). A grade has a many-to-many relationship with citizens.

| Method   | Endpoint                            | Min Role | Description                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/organizations/{org_id}/grades`    | admin    | Create grade                             |
| `GET`    | `/organizations/{org_id}/grades`    | member   | List grades in org                       |
| `GET`    | `/grades/{grade_id}`                | member   | Get grade detail                         |
| `PATCH`  | `/grades/{grade_id}`                | admin    | Update grade name                        |
| `DELETE` | `/grades/{grade_id}`                | admin    | Delete grade                             |
| `POST`   | `/grades/{grade_id}/citizens`       | admin    | Set citizens (replaces entire set)       |
| `POST`   | `/grades/{grade_id}/citizens/add`   | admin    | Add citizens (keeps existing)            |
| `POST`   | `/grades/{grade_id}/citizens/remove`| admin    | Remove specific citizens                 |

---

### Pictograms

Visual aids used across the platform. Pictograms can be **global** (no organization — available to everyone) or **org-specific** (only visible to members of that org). Listing pictograms with an `organization_id` returns both global and org-specific ones.

| Method   | Endpoint                           | Min Role              | Description               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/pictograms`                      | admin (if org-scoped) | Create with image URL     |
| `POST`   | `/pictograms/upload`               | admin (if org-scoped) | Upload image file         |
| `GET`    | `/pictograms?organization_id={id}` | JWT                   | List (global + org if specified) |
| `GET`    | `/pictograms/{pictogram_id}`       | JWT                   | Get pictogram             |
| `DELETE` | `/pictograms/{pictogram_id}`       | admin / superuser     | Delete pictogram          |

Deleting a global pictogram requires superuser status. Deleting an org-scoped pictogram requires admin role in that org.

Upload accepts JPEG, PNG, and WebP images up to 5MB.

---

### Invitations

Invitations let org admins invite users by email. The flow is: admin sends invite → receiver sees it in their pending list → receiver accepts (becomes a member) or rejects.

| Method   | Endpoint                                   | Min Role       | Description                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/organizations/{org_id}/invitations`      | admin          | Send invitation (by receiver email) |
| `GET`    | `/organizations/{org_id}/invitations`      | admin          | List pending invitations for org    |
| `DELETE` | `/organizations/{org_id}/invitations/{id}` | admin          | Revoke invitation                   |
| `GET`    | `/invitations/received`                    | JWT (receiver) | List my pending invitations         |
| `POST`   | `/invitations/{id}/accept`                 | JWT (receiver) | Accept — creates membership         |
| `POST`   | `/invitations/{id}/reject`                 | JWT (receiver) | Reject invitation                   |

Guards:
- Cannot invite a user who is already a member (`409`)
- Cannot create a duplicate pending invitation for the same user+org (`409`)
- Cannot invite a nonexistent email (`404`)
- Only the receiver can accept or reject (`403`)
- Rate-limited to **10 sends/minute** per authenticated user
